/**
 * Onboarding: "Explore a sample workspace". The client creates a real workspace (a FeltKit tenant,
 * client.createTenant("Northwind Labs")), adds the room agent to it (client.addMember), and calls
 * this in it: sample colleagues (personas: participants with no principal, so nobody can sign in as
 * them, listed in the workspace directory), an ongoing launch discussion, a thread, reactions, a
 * private channel, a DM, and the room agent in the directory. The caller (its owner) is the only real
 * member; everything in it works like any other workspace. Only into an empty workspace.
